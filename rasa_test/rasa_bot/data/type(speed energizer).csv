종족,스피드 에너자이저,"The SPEED ENERGIZER type are open to the various things that come from the world. You are interested in ""things you love (work)"" and uses energy for it. You also have quick action.↵↵You're very fast at doing something without sitting still. You always move around and do a lot of things, but you tend to omit, skip, forget, miss something because you are that fast. ↵ 'Huh? Where is my wallet? Oh, I left my car keys! Why it doesn’t work? ↵Everything is coming to you because you emit a comfortable and warm feeling. Not only people, work, love, but also flowers you see, beautiful music coming in, appetizing food and so on. So you can just wait.↵↵Also, it’s good to have a question that can be answered ‘yes or no’ from people around you. But most of the time, you approach and act before it comes to you. Why? Because you feel the pressure like “Be proactive. Take action!”. Also, you can't wait much longer because you think “I will do it” and act at the same time. How do you feel about the experience that you started first before you felt such a ‘Yes’ response?↵↵You are a person with vital energy in your body. This is an incredibly powerful energy. ",,2013
종족,스피드 에너자이저,"Depending on the way of your decision making, you will have a very different experience. Do you use energy for what you want and live a satisfying life, or are you suffering from chronic fatigue and suffering from satisfying others?↵↵This world is built by people like you. The development of civilization, cities, is the result of productivity with tremendous vital energy. You can be an exploited slave or an enterprising builder. SPEED ENERGIZER children should always be asked. Parents should ask their child a question that can be answered ""Yes or No"".",,2014
